Description

EasyDO, Easy to do.

EasyDo, therefore simply called app, is an application to manage your daily tasks in a easy and
intuitive fashion. 
The app allows you to create and manage new tasks, or TODOs. The way the user can interact with
the TODOs they create is by checking and unchecking them (telling that the task is complete or not,
respectively).
The user also have the option of archiving, and managing those archived TODOs, emailing the TODOs
and consulting a summary of all his TODOs to check some of his stats.

About the project
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The app was made as demanded by the CMPUT 301 - Software Engineering class of the University of Alberta.
The entire application, design, conception, development and testing was made solely by Cauani Castro,
exchange student in the supracited university, pursuing Bachelor's Degree on Computer Science, with 
student ID 1449721 and CCID of cauni.

For the development of the project, no outside code was copied.
Many websites were used for references and to clear some doubts, especially the Android Documentation,
which can be accessed on: https://developer.android.com/.
The http://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/icons-launcher.html website was used to format the
launcher image for the application.
